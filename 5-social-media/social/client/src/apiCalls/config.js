// First thing you should do is to create a config.js file inside the apiCalls folder
// and define the base url for the server here, so that if the server url changes in future
// you only need to change it here
// keep the base url for the server here, to which client will make requests
export const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080/";
